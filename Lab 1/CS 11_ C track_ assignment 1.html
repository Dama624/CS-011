<h1>C track: assignment 1</h1>
</center>

<hr>


<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>In this assignment you will learn the basics of compiling programs and the
most fundamental aspects of the C language.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>

<li><p>The Unix environment</p>

<p>You are expected to have an account on the CS cluster and to understand
the basics of using Unix, the filesystem, logging in and out, etc.  You
should also be familiar with the "<code>man</code>" command to access on-line
manual pages.  Note that all the C library functions have man pages which
describe their use in great detail.</p>

</li>

<li><p>Text editing</p>

<p>You are free to use whatever text editor you like.  Good ones include
<code>emacs</code>, <code>vi</code>, <code>nedit</code>, or
<code>pico</code>.  I recommend learning <code>emacs</code> because:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's incredibly powerful.</li>
<li>It provides syntax coloring for many programming languages, including C.</li>
<li>It allows you to access a lot of documentation through the Info system.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, teaching <code>emacs</code> is beyond the scope of this course.
You can type "&lt;control&gt;-h t" in <code>emacs</code> to bring up the
emacs tutorial.  If you are really pressed for time, <code>pico</code> or
<code>nedit</code> have a much shorter learning curve, but are also much less
powerful.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Getting set up on the CS cluster</h2>

<p><b>DO NOT SKIP THIS SECTION!</b></p>

<p>Many of you will want to develop and run your programs on your own computer,
and you are welcome to do so, but the official environment for developing your
programs is on the CS cluster.  This consists of (a) the computers in Annenberg
104 which run Linux, and (b) any remote login machines available for the
cluster.  [Currently, there are no remote login machines available on the
cluster, but we're working on it.] They all run the same software.  You need to
do a few small things to get set up to use an up-to-date programming environment
on the CS cluster.</p>

<p>The first rule is as follows:</p>

<p><b>Do not, under any circumstances, develop or run your programs on the CS
cluster machine called <code>login.cs.caltech.edu</code> or
<code>login.cms.caltech.edu</code>!</b>  This computer is not intended to be
used for program development at all.</p> 

<p>Instead, if you want to develop and test your code remotely, use a remote
login machine, if there is one.  It will work just like all the other CS cluster
computers in the lab.</p>

<p>The software for the CS 11 C track lives in the directory
<code>/cs/courses/cs11/install</code>.  In order to make this software available
to you, you need to do these simple steps:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Log in to a CS cluster computer.</p></li>

<li><p>Execute the following line in a terminal (where <code>%</code> represents
the terminal prompt):</p>

<pre>% cp /cs/courses/cs11/setup/bashrc-cs11 ~/.bashrc-cs11
</pre>

</li>

<li><p>If you do not have a file in your home directory called
<code>.bashrc</code> (use <code>ls -a</code> to check for files beginning with a
dot, which are normally hidden), execute the following line in the terminal:</p>

<pre>% cp ~setup/general.bashrc ~/.bashrc
</pre>

</li>

<li><p>At the end of your <code>.bashrc</code> file, add the following line:</p>

<pre>source ~/.bashrc-cs11
</pre>

</li>

</ol>

<p>Now log out and log back in again.  You're all set!</p>

<h2>Suggested Reading</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Darnell and Margolis, chapter 3.</p></li>

<li><p>K&amp;R, chapter 1 (all) and chapter 7 (pp. 153-159).  Some of the
material on <code>scanf</code> presupposes an understanding of
pointers.  Since you haven't seen pointers yet, I've included an "aside on
scanf" below to help you out.</p></li>

<li><p>If you don't understand the C compilation process, take a moment and
read <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/misc/compiling_c.html">this page</a> now.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Programs to write</h2>

<ul>

<li><code>hello1</code>

<p>Write a program called <code>hello1</code> to print "hello, world!" to the
terminal.  Use the <code>printf</code> function to do the printing.  Make sure
there is a newline at the end of the message.  Compile it using the
command:</p>

<pre>    % gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -ansi -pedantic hello1.c -o hello1
</pre>

<p>("%" is the unix shell prompt.)  <code>gcc</code> is the GNU C Compiler, whose
job it is to convert the file <code>hello1.c</code> (called <u>source code</u>;
this is the file you create) into a binary executable.  <code>hello1</code> is
the name of the binary program; the <code>-o</code> option tells the compiler
that the next argument is the name of the output file.  Don't worry about the
<code>-Wall</code>; it turns on compiler warnings so that the compiler will warn
you about anything it considers dubious but which is still legal.  It's a
good habit to use <code>-Wall</code> whenever you use gcc.  Note that although
almost all C compilers have some option for enabling or suppressing warnings,
there is no standard command-line option for these, so <code>-Wall</code> will
only work for gcc.  Make sure that your <code>main</code> function returns 0 or
the compiler will issue a warning.  The options <code>-Wstrict-prototypes -ansi
-pedantic</code> ensure that your program is ANSI-compliant and that your
prototypes have been declared correctly.  Don't worry about this for now, but
do use it; it will make your life much easier later on.</p></li>

<li><code>hello2</code>

<p>Modify <code>hello1.c</code> so that the program (now called <code>hello2</code>,
corresponding to the source code file <code>hello2.c</code>) prints a prompt
string (<i>e.g.</i> "Enter your name: "), after which you enter your name and
it prints "hello, &lt;your name&gt;!" to the terminal (with your name
substituted for "&lt;your name&gt;", of course).  <b>Make sure your program
prints a prompt string before reading the input</b> (a lot of people forget
to do this). The name you enter should be a single word only (say, your first
name).  Use the library function <code>scanf</code> to read the string from
standard input (also known as <code>stdin</code>) and print to standard
output (also known as <code>stdout</code>).  <code>stdin</code> and
<code>stdout</code> both represent input and output from the terminal (as opposed
to, say, a file).</p>

<p>ASIDE ON SCANF: <code>scanf</code> should be invoked as follows:</p>

<pre>    char s[100];  /* N.B. strings are arrays of chars in C */
    /* ... maybe some intervening code ... */
    scanf("%99s", s);
</pre>

<p>When run, the program will pause while executing the <code>scanf</code>
until you enter a string and hit return, or until 99 characters have been
entered (whichever comes first).  [<b>NOTE</b>: the reason you can't enter
100 characters with this code will be explained in a later lecture.] Then it
will continue.  The character array <code>s</code> will then contain the
string you entered, and can be passed to <code>printf</code>.  I will discuss
this in more detail in later lectures.  Note that <code>scanf</code> used as
above will also ignore anything past the first whitespace character (space or
tab).  There are ways to get around this, but they aren't important now (so
don't worry about it).  That's why your name should just be a single
word.</p></li>

<li><code>hello3</code>

<p>Modify <code>hello2</code> so that the program prints a prompt, you enter
your name, the computer generates a <u>single</u> random number
<code>n</code> between 1 and 10 and prints that many messages.  The format of
each message that you will print is: "&lt;n&gt;: hello, &lt;your name&gt;!"
or: "&lt;n&gt;: hi there, &lt;your name&gt;!", where &lt;n&gt; is the random
number you generated and &lt;your name&gt; is, well, your name.  Print the
first message when &lt;n&gt; (<b>not</b> the loop index variable) is even and
the second message when &lt;n&gt; is odd.  <b>All the messages for a single
run of the program will thus be identical.</b></p>

<p>I repeat: <b>All the messages for a single run of the program are
identical.</b> <u>Pay attention to this!</u> Every term, about half the
students print a different message depending on whether the loop index
variable is odd or even instead of n, or don't print the number n at all.  If
you do this, you'll have to redo the program and you'll lose marks.</p>

<p>By "loop index variable" I mean <i>e.g.</i> &nbsp;<code>i</code>&nbsp; in:
&nbsp; <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) ...</code>.</p>

<p>Use the <code>rand</code> library function to generate the random numbers; this
function is found in the <code>stdlib.h</code> header file, so be sure to add:</p>

<pre>    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>to the top of your program source code.  You will also need to "seed" the
random number generator to get it started; the best way to do this is to
include this line:</p>

<pre>    srand(time(0));
</pre>

<p>at the beginning of the program.  <code>srand</code> is also in
<code>stdlib.h</code>, but <code>time</code> is in the <code>time.h</code>
header file, so you should <code>#include</code> that as well.  Be aware that
there is not always 100% standardization on the locations of functions in
header files among different operating systems.  You should also look at the
man pages for <code>rand</code> and <code>srand</code>, which will contain
useful information.  To do this, type: &nbsp; <code>man 3 rand</code> &nbsp;
at the unix prompt (it's in section 3 of the online manuals; just <code>man
rand</code> will not work, because there is another <code>rand</code> that
has a man page).</p>

<p>A slightly tricky part of this task is converting from the return value of
<code>rand()</code>, which returns an int between 0 and <code>RAND_MAX</code>
(which is a large integer constant defined in <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>)
into a random number between 1 and 10.  There's more than one way to do
this.</p>

<p>ASIDE ON NUMERIC CONVERSIONS: You can convert an integer to a real number
(double or float) as follows:</p>

<pre>    int i = 10;
    double d = (double)i;  /* Convert int to double. */
    float f = (float)f;    /* Convert int to float.  */
</pre>

<p>Recall that doubles are double-precision while floats are
single-precision.  Similarly, you can convert real numbers (doubles or
floats) to integers as follows:</p>

<pre>    double d = 12.3;
    int i = (int)d;    /* Convert double to int. */
</pre>

<p>In this case, the conversion to integers throws away everything to the right
of the decimal point (the fractional part).  I'll talk about this more in
lecture 2.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>To hand in</h2>

<p>The <code>hello1.c</code>, <code>hello2.c</code>, and <code>hello3.c</code>
programs.  Before you hand them in, make sure that you run the <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/misc/c_style_check">style checking program</a> on all of them to catch
obvious style mistakes.  See the <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/misc/c_style_guide.html">style
guide</a> for more information on this.</p>
