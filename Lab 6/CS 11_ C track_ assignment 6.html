<h1>C track: assignment 6</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>In this assignment you will write a sorting program similar to the program
from lab 3, except that it uses linked lists instead of arrays to hold the
list of numbers read in off the command line.  In the process, you will learn
about one of the fundamental constructs in the C language (structs) and more
about pointers.</p>

<h2>Language concepts covered this week</h2>

<ul>

<li><p>structs</p>

<p>Structs provide a way to bundle together several related pieces of data
into a single piece of data.  Structs are commonly used to define new data
types.</p></li>

<li><p>typedefs</p>

<p>Typedefs are a way to give an alias (alternative name) for a type name.
Used correctly, they can make code both more concise and more readable.</p>
</li>

<li><p>linked lists</p>

<p>Linked lists are a fundamental data type that is constructed using
structs and pointers.  Linked lists are very common in real code, so it is
important that you become comfortable with using them.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Other concepts covered this week</h2>

<p>This lab covers sorting in a so-called "functional" style, whereby the
original data collection to be sorted is not altered by the sorting process.
Rather, the sorting process generates a new, sorted data collection.  If you
know the Scheme programming language (<i>e.g.</i> from CS 4) this style will
be familiar to you; if not, it's well worth learning about.</p>

<h2>Structs</h2>

<p>A struct is a data object which holds other data objects of arbitrary
pre-specified types.  These data objects are called the "fields" of the
struct, and they are generally conceptually related to each other.  For
instance, if you wanted a data object to hold the x-y coordinates of a point
on a graphical display screen, you could declare a struct to do this:</p>

<pre>    struct point
    {
        int x;
        int y;
    }
</pre>

<p>This declaration tells the compiler what a <code>point</code> is, but
doesn't create any points.  To do that you do this:</p>

<pre>    struct point p;  /* Creates a new point called 'p'. */
</pre>

<p>However, most C programmers use the following shortcut.  In C you can give
a type name an alias (alternative name) by using a <i>typedef</i>:</p>

<pre>    typedef struct point
    {
        int x;
        int y;
    } Point;
</pre>

<p>This defines <code>struct point</code> as above, and also declares
<code>Point</code> to be an alias for <code>struct point</code>.  Now you can
create a new <code>Point</code> like this:</p>

<pre>    Point p;
</pre>

<p>Note that <code>Point</code> and <code>point</code> are not the same
thing, because you don't use the <code>struct point</code> syntax
when you're declaring a <code>Point</code>.  In fact, writing <code>struct
Point</code> is invalid; you have to just write <code>Point</code>.  However,
a <code>Point</code> object is still a <code>struct</code>.</p>

<p>How do you use a struct?  You can access the field values in two different
ways.  The first way is to use the <code>.</code> operator:</p>

<pre>    int z;
    Point p;

    p.x = 10;  /* Set 'x' field of p to 10 */
    p.y = 20;  /* Set 'y' field of p to 20 */

    /* You can use 'p.x' syntax on either side of an assignment statement. */
    z = p.x + p.y;  /* = 30 */
</pre>

<p>The second way is used with pointers to structs.  Then you would normally
use the arrow (<code>-&gt;</code>) operator:</p>

<pre>    int z;
    Point p;
    Point *q;  /* pointer to a Point struct */

    q = &amp;p;    /* Now q points to p. */

    q-&gt;x = 10;  /* Set 'x' field to 10 */
    q-&gt;y = 20;  /* Set 'y' field  to 20 */

    /* You can use 'q-&gt;x' syntax on either side of an assignment statement. */
    z = q-&gt;x + q-&gt;y;  /* = 30 */
</pre>

<p>Note that <code>q-&gt;x</code> is nothing more than syntactic sugar for
<code>(*q).x</code>.</p>

<h2>Recursively-defined structs and singly-linked lists</h2>

<p>This lab will feature a new data type called a <i>singly-linked list</i>.
This is a very flexible data type; whole computer languages (<i>e.g.</i> Lisp
and Scheme) have been built around it.  We will restrict ourselves to a
singly-linked list of integers.  In C we only need one struct for this, which
we'll call a "node":</p>

<pre>    typedef
    struct _node
    {
      int data;             /* Each node stores a number */
      struct _node *next;   /* and a pointer to the next node in the list. */
    } node;
</pre>

<p>Actually, we are declaring a struct called <code>_node</code> and
<code>typedef</code>'ing it to the name <code>node</code>.  The interesting
thing about this struct is that it is recursively defined.  A
<code>node</code> has a <code>data</code> field which holds an integer and a
pointer to another <code>node</code> in its <code>next</code> field.</p>

<p>The way we use this is as follows.  We allocate memory for a bunch of
nodes, then we link the <code>next</code> field of one node to another node,
link the <code>next</code> field of that node to still another node, and so
on until all of the nodes are linked together.  We set the <code>next</code>
field of the last node to be equal to <code>NULL</code>, which lets us know
when we've hit the end.  <code>NULL</code> is a value <code>#define</code>'d
in <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> which cannot be the value of a valid pointer
(normally it is defined to be zero).  The code to create the list might look
something like this:</p>

<pre>    int i;
    int n_nodes = 10;  /* We want ten nodes. */
    node *list;        /* pointer to the list */
    node *temp, *prev; /* temporary pointers to nodes */

    /* Make the node at the front of the list first. */

    list = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));

    /* Check for malloc failure. */
    if (list == NULL)  /* malloc failed */
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: malloc() failed.\n");
        exit(1);  /* Give up, abort program. */
    }

    list-&gt;data = 1;
    list-&gt;next = NULL;  /* No other nodes yet. */

    /* Make the rest of the nodes and link them up. */

    prev = list;

    for (i = 0; i &lt; (n_nodes - 1); i++)
    {
        /* Create a new node. */
        temp = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));

        /* Check for malloc failure. */
        if (temp == NULL)  /* malloc failed */
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "Error: malloc() failed.\n");
            exit(1);  /* Give up, abort program. */
        }

        /* Initialize the new node. */
        temp-&gt;data = prev-&gt;data + 1;
        temp-&gt;next = NULL;

        /* Link previous node to the new node. */
        prev-&gt;next = temp;

        /* Set the 'prev' pointer to point to the new node. */
        prev = temp;
    }

    /*
     * Now, 'list' points to a list of ten nodes,
     * with values 1, 2, 3, ... 10 from front to back.
     */
</pre>

<p>Another way to do this is to create the list starting from the end node
and growing it backwards until you hit the first node.  This is actually
a lot easier:</p>

<pre>    int i, data;
    int n_nodes = 10;  /* We want ten nodes. */
    node *list;        /* pointer to the list */
    node *temp;        /* temporary pointer to node */
    list = NULL;       /* NULL represents the empty list. */
    data = 10;         /* Starting data value. */

    /* Make the nodes and link them up. */

    for (i = 0; i &lt; n_nodes; i++)
    {
        /* Create a new node. */
        temp = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));

        /* Check for malloc failure. */
        if (temp == NULL)  /* malloc failed */
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "Error: malloc() failed.\n");
            exit(1);  /* Give up, abort program. */
        }

        /* Initialize the new node. */
        temp-&gt;data = data;
        temp-&gt;next = list;

        /* Set the data value for the next node. */
        data--;

        /* Set the 'list' pointer to point to the new node. */
        list = temp;
    }

    /*
     * Now, 'list' points to a list of ten nodes,
     * with values 1, 2, 3, ... 10 from front to back.
     */
</pre>

<p>You should work through both of these examples until you understand why
they work.  It's easy to write linked list code which is much more
complicated than it needs to be if you're not clear on what's really
happening when you create nodes and link them up.</p>

<p>In fact, we've already written all the linked list routines that you'll
need for this lab.  They are described in the header file <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab6/linked_list.h">linked_list.h</a> and defined in the file <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab6/linked_list.c">linked_list.c</a>.  All you have to do is use them.
And make sure you <b>do</b> use them; we'll take points off for not using
them and instead writing the equivalent code out by hand.  That's a practice
called "reinventing the wheel" which is a bad habit; once someone else has
gone to the trouble of writing working, fully-debugged code, it doesn't make
sense to rewrite it yourself if their version works fine for your
purpose.</p>


<h2>Program to write</h2>

<p>The program to write for this lab is a variation on <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab3/lab3.html">lab 3</a>.  Recall that in that program, you input a
list of numbers and the program printed them out in sorted order.  This time
you will be doing the same thing, with these differences:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>You will use a linked list to store the numbers entered on the command
line.  This will have the advantage that you can enter an arbitrary number of
numbers (<i>i.e.</i> you're not limited to just 32 numbers).</p>

</li><li><p>You will use the "quicksort" algorithm to sort the numbers instead of
the minimal insertion sort or bubble sort.  Quicksort is much more efficient
than those algorithms, and is described below.</p>

</li></ol>

<p>Your program will be called <code>quicksorter</code>.  Here is the
specification:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>The program will accept an arbitrary number of numbers on the command
line, as long as there is at least one number.</p></li>

<li><p>If there are no command-line arguments, or if there are arguments but
none that represent numbers to be sorted, the program should print out
instructions on its use (<i>i.e.</i> a usage message).  By the way, don't
assume that the test script checks this; currently it doesn't, so check it
yourself (we will).</p></li>

<li><p>If any of the arguments to the program are not integers, your
program's response is undefined -- it can do anything.  (i.e. you shouldn't
worry about handling non-integer arguments).  The only exception to this is
the optional "<code>-q</code>" argument to suppress output (see
below).</p></li>

<li><p>The program will sort the numbers using the quicksort algorithm.  The
numbers on the command line will be stored in a linked list.  You should have
a separate <code>quicksort</code> function to do the sorting.  This function
should receive exactly <b>one</b> argument (the list to be sorted) and return
a pointer to a newly-allocated list which contains the same integers as the
input list, but in sorted (ascending) order.  Do <b>not</b> alter the
original list in any way.  Also, do not pass the length of the list to the
<code>quicksort</code> function (it isn't necessary anyway).</p></li>

<li><p>As in lab 3, use <code>assert</code> to check that the list is sorted
after doing the sort.  Use the <code>is_sorted()</code> function in
<code>linked_list.c</code> to check the list.  Put the <code>assert</code>
check at the end of the <code>quicksort</code> function, right before it
returns the sorted list.</p></li>

<li><p>Print out the numbers from smallest to largest, one per line.</p></li>

<li><p>Use the memory leak checker as in the previous assignment to check
that there are no memory leaks.</p></li>

</ol>

<h3>The Sample Output</h3>

<pre>    % <b>quicksorter 5 9 -2 150 -95 23 2 5 80</b>
    -95
    -2
    2
    5
    5
    9
    23
    80
    150
    % <b>quicksorter</b>
    usage: quicksorter [-q] number1 [number2 ... ]
    %
</pre>

<h3>Command-line options</h3>

<p>Add a "<code>-q</code>" command-line argument that suppresses output like
you did in assignment 3.  Make sure that even when this is in effect, you
still sort the numbers.  Also, make sure in all cases that you use the
<code>is_sorted()</code> function in <code>linked_list.c</code> (see below)
to test whether the sorted list is in fact sorted.  Your program should
accept single or multiple "<code>-q</code>" arguments on the command line
(just like lab 3), where multiple "<code>-q</code>" arguments are the same as
a single one, and if there are no numbers on the command line (<i>e.g.</i>
just "<code>-q</code>" arguments) the program should exit with a usage
message.</p>

<h3>The quicksort algorithm</h3>

<p>Quicksort is a sorting algorithm invented by the computer scientist
C. A. R. Hoare.  It is much more efficient than bubble sort or insertion sort
(technically, it has an O(n log n) average time complexity as compared to
O(n^2) for the other two algorithms).  Quicksort is usually used to sort an
array in place (there is even a C library function called <code>qsort</code>
which does this), but in this case we are sorting a linked list and we are
not modifying the original list, which changes the details of the algorithm
somewhat.  Quicksort is a recursive algorithm, like the algorithm you used to
solve the peg game in lab 4.</p>

<p>Here is the algorithm:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>If the list has zero nodes (<i>i.e.</i> it's empty) or one node, copy
the list as-is and return it (it's already sorted).  Note that this algorithm
works fine on empty lists.</p></li>

<li><p>Otherwise, create a copy of the first node of the list and "put it
aside" for now.</p></li>

<li><p>Divide the rest of the list into two new lists:</p>
     <ol>
     <li>The nodes with values larger than or equal to the value of the first
     node;</li>
     <li>the nodes with value smaller than the value of the first node.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Remember, you have to make these lists yourself and they have to copy
     the values in the original nodes.</p>
</li>

<li>Sort these two new lists using a recursive call to the
<code>quicksort</code> routine.</li>

<li><p>Append everything together in order:</p>
     <ol>
     <li>The list of nodes with values smaller than the first node,</li>
     <li>the copy of the first node,</li>
     <li>and the list of nodes with values larger than or equal to the first
     node.</li>
     </ol>
</li>

<p>Use the <code>append_lists</code> function defined in
<code>linked_list.c</code> to do the appending.</p>

</ol>

<h3>Memory management</h3>

<p>Remember, when you use <code>malloc</code> or <code>calloc</code> to
allocate memory, that memory must be explicitly freed (using the
<code>free</code> function) before the end of the program or you have a
<b>memory leak</b>.  It can be tricky avoiding memory leaks, but here is a
specific suggestion: don't ever do this:</p>

<pre>    node *list;
    /* ... some code which assigns values to 'list' ... */
    /* Sort the list and set the list pointer to point to the sorted list. */
    list = sort_list(list);
</pre>

<p>In this case, <code>sort_list()</code> returns a new (sorted) list, and
the list pointer <code>list</code> is set to the head of that list.  This is
a memory leak, because the old list that <code>list</code> pointed to was
never freed.  The right way to do this is as follows:</p>

<pre>    node *list;
    node *sorted_list;
    /* ... some code which assigns values to 'list' ... */
    /* Sort the list and set the list pointer to point to the sorted list. */
    sorted_list = sort_list(list);
    free_list(list);
    list = sorted_list;
</pre>

<p>The result is the same, but there's no memory leak.</p>

<p>Again, use the memory leak checker as you did last lab to make sure that
you haven't inadvertently leaked any memory.  Recall that you do this by
putting these lines at the top of the file <code>quicksorter.c</code>:</p>

<pre>    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include "memcheck.h"
</pre>

<p>and then putting this line in the <code>main</code> function before
exiting:</p>

<pre>    print_memory_leaks();
</pre>

<p>In addition, if you can't track down a memory leak you might try changing
the following line in <code>memcheck.c</code> from</p>

<pre>    #define DEBUG 0
</pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre>    #define DEBUG 1
</pre>

<p>and recompiling.  This will give more verbose output relating to memory
allocation.</p>

<h3>Code supplied</h3>

<p>There are a number of useful utility functions supplied in <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab6/linked_list.c">linked_list.c</a> and declared in <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab6/linked_list.h">linked_list.h</a>.  Please use these instead of
writing your own versions; it will save you a lot of time.  You will need to
<code>#include "linked_list.h"</code> in order for this to work.</p>

<h2>Testing your program</h2>

<p>This is the similar to the test script for assignment 3 (though not as
rigorous).  Also test your program on some numbers you generate by hand.  If
you need to use a debugger, read the <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/misc/gdb.html">gdb page</a>
to learn how to use <code>gdb</code> (the debugger for <code>gcc</code>).</p>

<h2>Supporting files</h2>
