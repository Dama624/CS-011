<h1>C track: assignment 7</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>This week, we are going to move beyond a discussion of built-in features
of the C language (we've covered most of them already) and continue
discussing how to implement fundamental data structures in C.  The data
structure we will implement for this assignment is called a <u>hash
table</u>.  Hash tables are among the most common and most useful
general-purpose data structures.  Many scripting languages, including perl
and python, include hash tables as fundamental data structures, but in C you
have to make them yourself.  We will see that the combination of C's structs,
arrays and pointers will make this relatively easy, if not completely
painless.</p>

<h2>Language concepts covered this week</h2>

<p>None.</p>

<h2>Other concepts covered this week</h2>

<p>Hash tables.</p>


<h2>Hash tables</h2>

<p>A hash table is a generalization of an array.  An array can be thought of
as a data structure that maps integers to items of a given type.  A hash
table can map arbitrary (constant) items of one type (known as "keys") to
items (not necessarily constant) of another type (known as "values").  Hash
tables are most often used to map strings to data, and that's what we'll be
doing here.  You can think of this as if you had an array which was indexed
by a string value instead of by an integer.  Note that hash tables are not
the only way to build such a mapping, but they are one of the most
efficient.</p>

<h3>Hash functions</h3>

<p>The basic idea behind a hash table is this.  You take your key and process
it with a special function called a "hash function".  This function will
transform any key into a non-negative integer with a bound which is
proportional to the size of the table.  In our case it will transform a
string into a value between 0 and 127.  Ideally, a hash function will map
different keys to different hash values so that a random population of keys
will give a uniform distribution of hash values.</p>

<h3>The data structure</h3>

<p>The hash table itself is essentially an array of linked lists.  In fact,
we define it as a struct which contains an array of linked lists as its only
field (in a real hash table implementation, there would be more fields, so
this is realistic; also, it gives you experience working with more complex
data structures).  The array indices are the same as the hash values (so in
our case the array length is exactly 128), and the linked lists are initially
empty (set to <code>NULL</code>).  Note that the linked lists are represented
as pointers to a node struct, just like in lab 6.  We'll refer to this array
below as the "node pointer array".</p>

<h3>Adding items to a hash table</h3>

<p>We add items to a hash table as a "key-value pair".  Let's say our keys
represent movie names and our values represent the rating of the movie in
stars (0-5).  A typical key-value pair might be ("The Matrix", 5).  First, we
compute the hash value for "The Matrix" (you'll see how below) and get (say)
47.  The 47th location in the node pointer array will initially be empty
(<i>i.e.</i> it will contain a <code>NULL</code> pointer).  We then create a
new linked list node.  The node's type will be different from what it was
last lab; here it will have <i>three</i> fields: a field called
<code>key</code> (a <code>char *</code> which holds the address of the string
used as a key), a field called <code>value</code> which holds the
<code>int</code> value, and a "next" pointer as before.  We put the (address
of the) key string into the <code>key</code> field (here, "The Matrix"), and
the value into the <code>value</code> field (here, 5).  We then link it to
location 47 in the hash table array by putting a pointer to the node in the
node pointer array at location 47.  The "next" field of the linked list node
itself will be <code>NULL</code>.  Later, we might want to add another entry,
say ("The Matrix Revolutions", 0).  First, we compute the hash value of "The
Matrix Revolutions".  Now one of two things could happen:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>If the hash value is not 47, we just create another linked list node
and add it to the place in the array corresponding to the hash value, just
as we did for the first item.</p></li>

<li><p>If the hash value is 47 again (which ideally it won't be), we create a
new linked list node.  Then we have to add it to the old linked list at array
position 47.  We do this by inserting the new node into the old linked list
at any point (the order doesn't matter).  Usually we either put it at the
front or the back of the list (putting it at the front is actually faster and
easier to program).  To do this we'll have to adjust some pointer
values.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Now you can see why hash values should be distributed randomly over the
set of all possible keys: if all keys hashed to 47, we would end up with just
a single linked list at one location in the array and nothing anywhere else.
In that case, looking up elements would take time proportional to the number
of entries (as it does with linked lists).  If most of the linked lists are
either empty or have only one or two values, lookup will require a constant
(small) amount of time.  Of course, as the number of elements in the hash
table increases in size eventually all the slots will be occupied even with a
perfect hash function.  At this point you should probably create a bigger
hash table, but we won't worry about this in this lab.</p>


<h3>Retrieving items from a hash table</h3>

<p>To retrieve an item from a hash table means to retrieve the value given
the key.  The way this is done is as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>Compute the hash value for the key.</li>

<li>Find the location in the node pointer array corresponding to the hash
value.</li>

<li>Search the linked list at that location for the key.  In general,
there will be a very small number of items in the linked list (usually one or
none), so the search will not take long.</li>

<li>If the key is found, return the value.  If not, return a "not found"
value (this will become clearer later).  If there was no linked list at that
location in the array, also return the "not found" value.</li>

</ul>

<p>As we said above, this means that our linked list nodes have to have three
elements:</p>

<ol>

<li>the key</li>

<li>the value associated with the key</li>

<li>a pointer to the next node, which may be <code>NULL</code> if there is
no next node.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Program to write</h2>

<p>Your program will use a hash table to count the number of occurrences of
words in a text file.  The basic algorithm goes as follows.  For each word in
the file:</p>

<ol>

<li>Look up the word in the hash table.</li>

<li>If it isn't there, add it to the hash table with a value of 1.  In this
case you'll have to create a new node and link it to the hash table as
described above.</li>

<li>If it is there, add 1 to its value.  In this case you don't create a new
node.</li>

</ol>

<p>At the end of the program, you should output all the words in the file,
one per line, with the count next to the word <i>e.g.</i></p>

<pre>    cat 2
    hat 4
    green 12
    eggs 3
    ham 5
    algorithmic 14
    deoxyribonucleic 3
    dodecahedron 400
</pre>

<p>Also, make sure that you explicitly free all memory that you've allocated
during the run of the program before your program exits.  This includes:</p>

<ol>

<li>all the nodes in the linked lists that the hash table's node pointer
array points to,</li>

<li>the hash table's node pointer array itself,</li>

<li>the hash table struct itself,</li>

<li>the string keys used in the linked list nodes (allocated in the
    <tt>main()</tt> function (see below)).</li>

</ol>

<p>The memory leak checker will help ensure that you get this right ;-)</p>

<h3>The hash function</h3>

<p>The hash function you will use is extremely simple: it will go through the
string a character at a time, convert each character to an integer, add up
the integer values, and return the sum modulo 128 (but don't use a magic
number for this).  This will give an integer in the range of [0, 127].  This
is a poor hash function; for one thing, anagrams will always hash to the same
value.  However, it's very simple to implement.  Note that a value of type
<code>char</code> in a C program can also be treated as if it were an
<code>int</code>, because internally it's a one-byte integer represented by
the ASCII character encoding.  If you like, you can convert the
<code>char</code> to an <code>int</code> explicitly using a type cast.
However, a string of characters is <b>not</b> an <code>int</code>, and you
can't use <code>atoi</code> to convert it into one (mainly because most of
the keys will be words, not string representations of numbers).  You also
shouldn't try to type cast the string to an <code>int</code> (it'll just cast
the address into an integer, which might work but it's not what you want).  A
string is an array of <code>chars</code>, which is not the same as a single
<code>char</code>; keep that in mind.  So you'll need a loop to go through
the string character-by-character.</p>

<h3>Other details</h3>

<p>Since a value associated with a key will always be positive, if you search
for a key and don't find it in a hash table, just return 0.  That's the
special "not found" value for this hash table.</p>

<p>For simplicity, the program assumes that the input file has one word per
line (we've written this code for you).  The order of the words you output
isn't important, since the test script will sort them.</p>


<h3>Things to watch out for</h3>

<p>You should design your hash table functions to be generic <i>i.e.</i>
independent of the purpose those functions are used for.  Specifically,
<b>don't</b> assume that particular values to be assigned mean anything
special (for instance, don't assume that assigning a value of 1 means that a
key doesn't exist in the table, just because that's how it will be used in
the rest of the program).  You should think of the hash table functions as
being part of a hash table library that you are writing.  Functions in a
library could be used in many different programs, so the fewer the
assumptions you make about how the functions will be used, the better.  The
only exception to this is the rule that says if you are searching for a key
and it isn't found, you should return zero.  That's not very generic (you can
imagine a hash table in which it would be OK to store a value of zero), but
it makes the program simpler.</p>

<p>There is one memory leak which may be hard to get rid of which involves
the <code>set_value</code> function.  You should assume that the key value
that is passed to <code>set_value</code> is newly-allocated, and so it either
has to go into the hash table or it has to be freed.</p>

<h3>Supporting files</h3>

<p>To simplify your task, we're supplying you with:</p>

<ul>

<li>a <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab7/hash_table.h">header file</a>. <b>Please read this file!</b>
It describes the data structures for the hash table and also a useful
<code>#define</code>.  A lot of the problems that students have with this lab
are a direct result of not reading this file carefully.  In particular, make
sure you understand the <code>hash_table</code> struct, because if you don't,
the program will be impossible to get right.</li>

<li>a <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab7/hash_table.c">template file</a> for your code; this file will
be called "hash_table.c".</li>
<li>a <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab7/main.c">main file</a></li>
<li>a <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab7/Makefile">Makefile</a></li>
<li>a <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab7/test.in">test input file</a></li>
<li>a <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab7/correct_test.out">test output file</a></li>
<li>a <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab7/run_test">test script</a></li>
<li>The memory leak checker: <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab7/memcheck.c">memcheck.c</a> and
    <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab7/memcheck.h">memcheck.h</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>All you have to do is to fill in the definitions in the template file.
Don't change anything in the other files.</p>

<h2>Testing your program</h2>

<p>The program name is <code>test_hash_table</code>.  It takes one
command-line argument, which is an input file of words.  Here, the test input
file is called <code>test.in</code>, so to run the program you would
type:</p>

<pre>% test_hash_table test.in
</pre>

<p>This will print a list of word/number pairs to <code>stdout</code>.  To
check if this is the right list, type <tt>make test</tt> to run the test
script on your program.  The test script will run your program on
<code>test.in</code> and will compare the output of the program to the
correct output.  Don't hand in the program until it passes the test.  Also
make sure that there are no memory leaks (the memory leak checker will report
these).</p>

<h2>For extra credit...</h2>

<p>As we mentioned above, you aren't supposed to change anything other than the
definitions in the template file.  However, the resulting design is not the
cleanest possible design from the standpoint of managing memory.  If you
<i>were</i> allowed to change something in the file <code>main.c</code> as
well as in the template file, how would you do this in order to create a
cleaner design?  Why would this design be better than the existing design?
You can put your answer in comments in the <code>main.c</code> file.  Don't
change any of the code in the <code>main.c</code> file, however; just say
what you <i>would</i> do.  Also, leave a note in the comments at the top of
the <code>hash_table.c</code> file that you've modified <code>main.c</code>,
so we know we should look at it.</p>

<hr>

<h2>To hand in</h2>

<p>The file <code>hash_table.c</code>, and the <code>main.c</code> file if you
have done the extra credit question (and <i>only</i> if you have done
that!).</p>
